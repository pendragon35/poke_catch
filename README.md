# poke_catch
Catch rate calculator for Pokemon

Still in progress

Future features:  
Pulls base catch rate info from Serebii.net  
Calculates catch rate for different pokemon/statuses/balls/etc  
Suggests an optimal pokeball based on %/cost

Later:  
use node.js for webapp interface
different dictionaries for different games, scraper can tell apart

Known issues:  
\#382 Kyogre has parsing problems (due to differing catch rate in XY/ORAS)  
\#383 Groudon, #384 Rayquaza has same problems  
Above Pokemon hardcoded to ORAS values, since can't catch in XY
